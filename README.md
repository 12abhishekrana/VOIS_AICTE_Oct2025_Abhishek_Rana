Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis
Project Overview

The Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis project is a comprehensive study that explores Airbnb listing data to uncover trends and patterns related to pricing, availability, review ratings, and host performance. This project aims to provide actionable insights to help hosts optimize pricing, improve availability, and enhance guest satisfaction while assisting Airbnb management in making data-driven decisions.

Problem Statement

Airbnb hosts and guests face challenges in understanding market trends and optimizing pricing and availability. This project analyzes Airbnb data to answer key questions such as:

What factors influence Airbnb listing prices?

How does availability vary with host listing count?

Do verified hosts get higher review ratings?

How do neighbourhood groups and room types impact review ratings and prices?

What is the relationship between price and service fee?

Project Objectives

Clean and preprocess Airbnb listing data.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Visualize data trends and correlations.

Provide actionable insights for hosts, guests, and Airbnb management.

Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the Airbnb Open Dataset, containing listing details, host information, pricing, availability, and review ratings.

Technologies Used

Python – Main programming language.

Pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation.

NumPy – Numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development environment.
